This will execute smart contact transactions.

The current version of this app has a smart contact that has been deplyed to the polygon mumbai test net, and code that can interact with that smart contract.

Every interaction with the smart contract creates a block.
The next plan is to interact with that block and parse the data from the block to display in the front end. So every can see the breaking stories for people "blowing a whistle"

There's more work to be done, but this is meant to be an MVP.
